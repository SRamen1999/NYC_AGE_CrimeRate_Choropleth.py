# NYC_AGE_CrimeRate_Choropleth.py

Uses open source data from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc \
and a geojson file of NYC https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm 

This program uses publicly avaibale police data that reports crimes in different areas around NYC. \
Then extract the data and make multiple choropleth maps using the same threshold_scale to see the difference \
of crime rate based on age in each NYC borough.
